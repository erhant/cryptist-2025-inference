# Verifiable & Private Inference

> This talk explores methods for verifiable and private LLM inference, focusing on novel approaches that target the transformer model, besides the existing ZK or FHE based solutions. We will discuss the limitations of ZK and FHE, and introduce alternative techniques that enhance privacy and verifiability in LLM inference, particularly in the context of permissionless systems with trustless inference providers.
